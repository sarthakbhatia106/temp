    <h1>What are Cookies?</h1>
    <p>
      Cookies are data, stored in small text files, on your computer. When a web
      server has sent a web page to a browser, the connection is shut down, and
      the server forgets everything about the user. Cookies were invented to
      solve the problem "how to remember information about the user":<br />
      1. When a user visits a web page, his/her name can be stored in a
      cookie.<br />
      2. Next time the user visits the page, the cookie "remembers" his/her
      name.<br />
      Cookies are saved in name-value pairs like:<br />
      username = Sarthak Bhatia<br />
      When a browser requests a web page from a server, cookies belonging to the
      page are added to the request. This way the server gets the necessary data
      to "remember" information about users.
    </p>
    <h1>Create a Cookie with JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
      JavaScript can create, read, and delete cookies with the document.cookie
      property. With JavaScript, a cookie can be created like this:<br />

      <em>document.cookie = "username=Sarthak Bhatia";</em><br />
      You can also add an expiry date (in UTC time). By default, the cookie is
      deleted when the browser is closed:<br />

      <em
        >document.cookie = "username=Sarthak Bhatia; expires=Thu, 18 Dec 2013 12:00:00
        UTC";</em
      ><br />
      With a path parameter, you can tell the browser what path the cookie
      belongs to. By default, the cookie belongs to the current page.<br />

      <em
        >document.cookie = "username=Sarthak Bhatia; expires=Thu, 18 Dec 2013 12:00:00
        UTC; path=/";</em
      >
    </p>

    <h1>Read a Cookie with JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
      With JavaScript, cookies can be read like this:<br />
      <em>var x = document.cookie;</em>
    </p>

    <h1>Change a Cookie with JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
      With JavaScript, you can change a cookie the same way as you create it:<br />
      <em
        >document.cookie = "username=Sarthak Bhatia; expires=Thu, 18 Dec 2013
        12:00:00 UTC; path=/";</em
      ><br />
      The old cookie is overwritten.
    </p>

    <h1>Delete a Cookie with JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
      Deleting a cookie is very simple. You don't have to specify a cookie value
      when you delete a cookie. Just set the expires parameter to a past
      date:<br />

      <em
        >document.cookie = "username=; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 UTC;
        path=/;";</em
      ><br />
    </p>

    <h1>
        Live Demo
    </h1>
    <p>
        Here if we click on the button a web page open where user selects a colour and that colour is saved in cookies.
        Even after refreshing or closing the browser colour remains the same.
    </p>

    <button>Click here to go to live demo</button>

    <script>
      let btn = document.querySelector("button");
      btn.addEventListener("click", function () {
        location.assign("cookiesDemo.html");
      });
    </script>
