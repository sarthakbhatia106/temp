    <h1>Some of the common web security issues and their prevention</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h2>Injection flaws</h2>
        <p>
          Injection flaws result from a classic failure to filter untrusted
          input. It can happen when you pass unfiltered data to the SQL server
          (SQL injection), to the browser (XSS – we’ll talk about this later),
          to the LDAP server (LDAP injection), or anywhere else. The problem
          here is that the attacker can inject commands to these entities,
          resulting in loss of data and hijacking clients’ browsers. Anything
          that your application receives from untrusted sources must be
          filtered, preferably according to a whitelist. You should almost never
          use a blacklist, as getting that right is very hard and usually easy
          to bypass. Antivirus software products typically provide stellar
          examples of failing blacklists. Pattern matching does not work.
        </p>
        <h3>Prevention</h3>
        <p>
          The good news is that protecting against injection is “simply” a
          matter of filtering your input properly and thinking about whether an
          input can be trusted. But the bad news is that all input needs to be
          properly filtered, unless it can unquestionably be trusted (but the
          saying “never say never” does come to mind here). In a system with
          1,000 inputs, for example, successfully filtering 999 of them is not
          sufficient, as this still leaves one field that can serve as the
          Achilles heal to bring down your system. And you might think that
          putting an SQL query result into another query is a good idea, as the
          database is trusted, but if the perimeter is not, the input comes
          indirectly from guys with malintent. This is called Second Order SQL
          Injection in case you’re interested. Since filtering is pretty hard to
          do right (like crypto), what I usually advise is to rely on your
          framework’s filtering functions: they are proven to work and are
          thoroughly scrutinized. If you do not use frameworks, you really need
          to think hard about whether not using them really makes sense in your
          server security context. 99% of the time it does not.

        <h2>Broken Authentication</h2>
        <p>
          This is a collection of multiple problems that might occur during
          broken authentication, but they don’t all stem from the same root
          cause. Assuming that anyone still wants to roll their own
          authentication code in 2014 (what are you thinking??), I advise
          against it. It is extremely hard to get right, and there are a myriad
          of possible pitfalls, just to mention a few:<br />
          1. The URL might contain the session id and leak it in the referer
          header to someone else.<br />
          2. The passwords might not be encrypted either in storage or
          transit.<br />
          3. The session ids might be predictable, thus gaining access is
          trivial.<br />
          4. Session fixation might be possible.<br />
          5. Session hijacking might be possible, timeouts not implemented right
          or using HTTP (no SSL security), etc…<br />
        </p>
        <h3>Prevention</h3>
        <p>
          The most straightforward way to avoid this web security vulnerability
          is to use a framework. You might be able to implement this correctly,
          but the former is much easier. In case you do want to roll your own
          code, be extremely paranoid and educate yourself on what the pitfalls
          are. There are quite a few.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</h2>
        <p>
          This is a fairly widespread input sanitization failure (essentially a
          special case of common mistake #1). An attacker gives your web
          application JavaScript tags on input. When this input is returned to
          the user unsanitized, the user’s browser will execute it. It can be as
          simple as crafting a link and persuading a user to click it, or it can
          be something much more sinister. On page load the script runs and, for
          example, can be used to post your cookies to the attacker.
        </p>
        <h3>Prevention</h3>
        <p>
          There’s a simple web security solution: don’t return HTML tags to the
          client. This has the added benefit of defending against HTML
          injection, a similar attack whereby the attacker injects plain HTML
          content (such as images or loud invisible flash players) – not
          high-impact but surely annoying (“please make it stop!”). Usually, the
          workaround is simply converting all HTML entities, so that script is
          returned as &lt;script&gt;. The other often employed method of
          sanitization is using regular expressions to strip away HTML tags
          using regular expressions on < and >, but this is dangerous as a lot
          of browsers will interpret severely broken HTML just fine. Better to
          convert all characters to their escaped counterparts.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Insecure Direct Object References</h2>
        <p>
          This is a classic case of trusting user input and paying the price in
          a resulting security vulnerability. A direct object reference means
          that an internal object such as a file or database key is exposed to
          the user. The problem with this is that the attacker can provide this
          reference and, if authorization is either not enforced (or is broken),
          the attacker can access or do things that they should be precluded
          from. For example, the code has a download.php module that reads and
          lets the user download files, using a CGI parameter to specify the
          file name (e.g., download.php?file=something.txt). Either by mistake
          or due to laziness, the developer omitted authorization from the code.
          The attacker can now use this to download any system files that the
          user running PHP has access to, like the application code itself or
          other data left lying around on the server, like backups. Uh-oh.
          Another common vulnerability example is a password reset function that
          relies on user input to determine whose password we’re resetting.
          After clicking the valid URL, an attacker can just modify the username
          field in the URL to say something like “admin”. Incidentally, both of
          these examples are things I myself have seen appearing often “in the
          wild”.
        </p>
        <h3>Prevention</h3>
        <p>
          Perform user authorization properly and consistently, and whitelist
          the choices. More often than not though, the whole problem can be
          avoided by storing data internally and not relying on it being passed
          from the client via CGI parameters. Session variables in most
          frameworks are well suited for this purpose.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Security misconfiguration</h2>
        <p>
          In my experience, web servers and applications that have been
          misconfigured are way more common than those that have been configured
          properly. Perhaps this because there is no shortage of ways to screw
          up. Some examples:<br />
          1. Running the application with debug enabled in production.<br />
          2. Having directory listing enabled on the server, which leaks
          valuable information.<br />
          3. Running outdated software (think WordPress plugins, old
          PhpMyAdmin).<br />
          4. Having unnecessary services running on the machine.<br />
          5. Not changing default keys and passwords. (Happens way more
          frequently than you’d believe!)<br />
          6. Revealing error handling information to the attackers, such as
          stack traces.<br />
        </p>
        <h3>Prevention</h3>
        <p>
          Have a good (preferably automated) “build and deploy” process, which
          can run tests on deploy. The poor man’s security misconfiguration
          solution is post-commit hooks, to prevent the code from going out with
          default passwords and/or development stuff built in.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Sensitive data exposure</h2>
        <p>
          This web security vulnerability is about crypto and resource
          protection. Sensitive data should be encrypted at all times, including
          in transit and at rest. No exceptions. Credit card information and
          user passwords should never travel or be stored unencrypted, and
          passwords should always be hashed. Obviously the crypto/hashing
          algorithm must not be a weak one – when in doubt, web security
          standards recommend AES (256 bits and up) and RSA (2048 bits and up).
          And while it goes without saying that session IDs and sensitive data
          should not be traveling in the URLs and sensitive cookies should have
          the secure flag on, this is very important and cannot be
          over-emphasized.
        </p>
        <h3>Prevention</h3>
        <p>
          • In transit: Use HTTPS with a proper certificate and PFS (Perfect
          Forward Secrecy). Do not accept anything over non-HTTPS connections.
          Have the secure flag on cookies.<br/>
           • In storage: This is harder. First and foremost, you need to lower your exposure. If you don’t need
          sensitive data, shred it. Data you don’t have can’t be stolen. Do not
          store credit card information ever, as you probably don’t want to have
          to deal with being PCI compliant. Sign up with a payment processor
          such as Stripe or Braintree. Second, if you have sensitive data that
          you actually do need, store it encrypted and make sure all passwords
          are hashed. For hashing, use of bcrypt is recommended. If you don’t
          use bcrypt, educate yourself on salting and rainbow tables.<br/> And at the
          risk of stating the obvious, do not store the encryption keys next to
          the protected data. That’s like storing your bike with a lock that has
          the key in it. Protect your backups with encryption and keep your keys
          very private. And of course, don’t lose the keys!
