    <h1>Web Development</h1>
    <p style="font-size:x-large;">
        Web development is the work involved in developing a Web site for the
        Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web
        development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain
        text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social
        network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web
        development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web
        content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting,
        Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.
        Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main
        non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding.[2]
        Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content
        changes easier and available with basic technical skills. For larger
        organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of
        hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile
        methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller organizations may only
        require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary
        assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or
        information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative
        effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated
        department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization:
        front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.
        Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in
        the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers.

    <h1>Practical Web Development</h1>
    <h3 style="font-size: x-large;">Basic</h3>
    <p style="font-size: x-large;">In practice, many Web developers will have basic interdisciplinary skills / roles,
        including:
    <ul style="font-size: x-large;">
        <li>Graphic design / Web design</li>
        <li>Information architecture and copywriting/copyediting with Web usability, accessibility and search engine
            optimization in mind</li>
        <li>Mobile responsiveness</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3 style="font-size: x-large;">Testing</h3>
    <p style="font-size: x-large;">Testing is the process of evaluating a system or its component(s) with the intent to find whether it satisfies
        the specified requirements or not. Testing is executing a system in order to identify any gaps, errors, or
        missing requirements contrary to the actual requirements. The extent of testing varies greatly between
        organizations, developers, and individual sites or applications.</p>
